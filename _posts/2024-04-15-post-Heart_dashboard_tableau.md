Today I would like to analyze a super interesting dataset about **heart disease**. The dataset has been taken from the Kaggle website. 

The dataset presents 18 columns categories and the column names are:

I would like to dive deep into the data, and afterward present the results over several charts using tableau software. Asuasaul we will start and present the Dashboard I make using Tableau. In order to analyze the data I used, as always - python.

Here a brief overview of the dashboard:

In my initial analysis, I aim to explore the relationship between heart disease and various health conditions, including asthma, diabetes, kidney disease, skin cancer, and stroke. A particular focus will be placed on understanding how these conditions manifest differently between males and females. For instance, upon examining the data, we observed a notable contrast in the prevalence of heart disease and diabetes between genders, with 1,767 more males affected than females. Additionally, our investigation revealed a significant disparity in the incidence of heart disease and skin cancer, with 1,624 more cases among males compared to females.
Letâ€™s see the outcome illustration :

For my upcoming research, I intend to examine the Body Mass Index (BMI) among individuals diagnosed with heart disease. Firstly, let's delve into what BMI represents.


BMI, or Body Mass Index, serves as a measure to evaluate an individual's weight concerning their height. This calculation involves dividing a person's weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters (BMI = weight in kg / (height in meters)^2). By providing a straightforward numerical assessment of body fatness, BMI assists in categorizing people into groups like underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.
In our forthcoming analysis, our focus will be on scrutinizing the distribution of BMI among smokers within the population. Data suggests that among those afflicted with heart disease, there exist smokers whose BMI falls within the lower spectrum (0-30).

In the next chart I would like to find the interaction between Gender ( Male VS Female ) to Ethnicity ( American Indian , Asian , Black , Hispanic and white. In other words we would like to know,how many white males and white female are
