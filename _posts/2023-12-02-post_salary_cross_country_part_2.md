**Distribution of Salaries Among Various Job Categories**

The salary distribution across different job groups, spanning Human Resources (HR), Research and Development (R&D), Sales, Accountancy, Marketing, Design, and Operations, will be comprehensively detailed, shedding light on the compensation structures within each domain. To ensure a comprehensive understanding, both mean and median values will be provided, offering clarity on the central tendencies in salary ranges for these diverse job categories. This approach not only captures the variability within each group but also facilitates a nuanced analysis of the overall compensation landscape across various functional areas within the organization.


In the upcoming chart, we present an analysis of job titles in correlation with salary ranges. Job titles are depicted along the y-axis, while salary ranges are indicated on the x-axis; each dot on the plot represents a particular job title and its associated salary range. This visual presentation offers a rapid and lucid insight into the correlation between diverse job titles and the corresponding salary brackets. The graphical representation enhances the efficiency of comprehending the distribution of salaries across different roles, providing valuable insights into the compensation structure within the organization.

**Analyzing the Relationship Between Job Titles and Educational Requirements**

Our upcoming research aims to examine the correlation between two key variables: *education level* and *job type*. To enhance clarity, I've undertaken a brief categorization of the various job types within the dataset. I've organized these roles into three distinct groups: **R&D, Sales, and Operations**. The correlation between these variables becomes more apparent as the numerical values increase.
