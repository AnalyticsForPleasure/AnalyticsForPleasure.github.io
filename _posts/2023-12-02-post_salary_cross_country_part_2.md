**Mapping Educational Requirements to Job Titles in the Hi-Tech Industry**

We are eager for you to explore the *correlation between 'Job Title' and 'Education Level.'* Within the dataset, we have 126 job titles. To streamline our analysis, we have chosen 8 specific job titles within the hi-tech industry. Our goal is to examine the requisite education levels associated with each of these selected job titles.
