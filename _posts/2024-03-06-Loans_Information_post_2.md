In our previous discussion, we explored two primary inquiries: identifying the states where residents tend to borrow the most and determining the most active loan-taking region among the Northeast, West, Southeast, Midwest, and Southwest.

As we delve further into the dataset, we encounter an intriguing variable: **"annual_income"**. This prompts me to pose the following question: 

**Could there be a relationship between the average income in different regions and the frequency of loans taken out?**


Consequently, I aim to examine the *relationship between the number of loans and average income for each region* (Midwest, Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, and West, as previously defined). Specifically, I seek to understand whether regions with higher average incomes exhibit a higher frequency of loan acquisitions. Conversely, do regions with lower average incomes experience fewer loan transactions?

Hence, as a follow-up to the second question posed in the previous post, I intend to address this inquiry by implementing the following code.

Now, let's take a look at the resulting output:
