As we all know, a basketball player can be recruited to play for the NBA  league when he reaches the age of 18 ( Draft age limit ) means after high- school,  or after several years at college. Sometimes the young players play at different leagues in Europe and then try to give a shot of going to the upper level of basketball - NBA league .

On the other side of the scale, many players finish their NBA career because of injuries or not being prepared right to play 83 games  per season or not mentaly strong. Other reasons can be: No team selected them or no team wants to give them a new contract.

Therefore, the next subject we would want to explore is by dealing with the number of seasons an NBA player plays at the professional level of a basketball league.

Now, let dive into the code:

Let's we now the results from the histogram on a table:

In the past, players would be selected at the draft lottery pick, and after playing their entire career  with the same organization team, the player has been retired. Nowadays, the story is totally different. Players can be moved away from their playing teams many times during their career. 
Therefore, we want to drill down and understand the story behind the statistical numbers of trades and movements that have been made by management teams and players.


In other words we are willing to know  -




**How many times has each player changed in jerseys during his career?**


Here is the code reference for answering this question:

As we can notice from the output above - 851 players ,during the last 25 seasons, played in the same jersey their entire careers. In other words,  over their rookie season and in their retirement season they played with the same jersey.
