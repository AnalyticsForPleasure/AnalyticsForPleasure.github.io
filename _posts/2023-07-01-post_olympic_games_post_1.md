**Introduction**

The Olympic Games, a global sporting extravaganza held every four years, stand as a testament to the pinnacle of athletic excellence and international unity. Among the myriad of disciplines showcased at this grand event, swimming commands a special spotlight during the Summer Olympics. Swimming has been an integral part of the Olympic program since the inception of the modern Games in 1896, evolving into one of the most anticipated and celebrated events. Athletes from diverse nations converge in state-of-the-art aquatic arenas, competing across various swimming styles such as **freestyle, backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly**. *The swimming events not only showcase the incredible speed, technique, and endurance of the competitors but also foster a sense of camaraderie as nations come together to witness and applaud the remarkable feats achieved in the water*.

The Summer Olympics' swimming competitions have produced iconic moments that have etched themselves into the annals of sports history. Legendary swimmers like *Michael Phelps* and *Katie Ledecky* have become synonymous with Olympic glory, breaking records and setting new standards of excellence. The electrifying atmosphere in the swimming venue, coupled with the global viewership, elevates the sport to a pinnacle of excitement and anticipation. Beyond the medals and records, the swimming events at the Summer Olympics symbolize the universal pursuit of human potential, with athletes striving for personal bests and nations uniting to celebrate the awe-inspiring achievements in the pool.

**Improvement of the team in Olympic swimming events**


Embarking on our initial analysis, I am eager to delve into a concise research endeavor aimed at assessing *the improvements made by each of the selected eight teams in men's 200-meter races* across various disciplines, including backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly, individual medley, and freestyle. The participating countries are 'USA,' 'AUS,' 'GBR,' 'JPN,' 'GER,' 'CAN,' 'GDR,' and 'HUN.' The primary objective is to uncover and understand the specific improvements achieved by each team over the years in these distinct swimming strokes. 

Isn't the prospect of exploring the advancements in backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly, individual medley, and freestyle strokes intriguing?

In the history of the Olympic swimming event, which commenced in 1912, numerous swimmers have achieved success by earning bronze, silver, and gold medals. Our upcoming research focuses on identifying elite swimmers **who have demonstrated exceptional performance by winning more than two medals** throughout their participation in the Olympic swimming games. To achieve this, we have divided the mission into two parts: one for *Men* and another for *Women*. The results are visualized through bar charts to provide a clear illustration of the accomplished swimmers in each category.

While examining the output charts, it becomes evident that as we move towards the right side of the bars, the number of elite swimmers decreases progressively. This reduction is attributed to the challenges associated with consistently achieving bronze, silver, and gold medals throughout a swimmer's career. *It is noteworthy that only a limited number of swimmers have managed to secure 5 medals or more.*

The chart below highlights **Katie Ledecky** as the most accomplished female swimmer, securing a total of 7 medalsâ€”a feat unmatched by any other female participant in swimming events. Ledecky made a splash in her international debut at the 2012 London Olympic Games at the age of 15, clinching an unexpected gold medal in the women's 800-meter freestyle. By the time the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro concluded, she had solidified her status as the most decorated female athlete, boasting four gold medals, one silver medal, and two world records. In the 2020 Olympic Games, Ledecky continued her exceptional performance, earning recognition as the most decorated U.S. female athlete. Notably, she became the first American female swimmer to secure an individual event victory in three consecutive Olympiads.
