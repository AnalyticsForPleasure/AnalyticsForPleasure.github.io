**Introduction**

The Olympic Games, a global sporting extravaganza held every four years, stand as a testament to the pinnacle of athletic excellence and international unity. Among the myriad of disciplines showcased at this grand event, swimming commands a special spotlight during the Summer Olympics. Swimming has been an integral part of the Olympic program since the inception of the modern Games in 1896, evolving into one of the most anticipated and celebrated events. Athletes from diverse nations converge in state-of-the-art aquatic arenas, competing across various swimming styles such as **freestyle, backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly**. *The swimming events not only showcase the incredible speed, technique, and endurance of the competitors but also foster a sense of camaraderie as nations come together to witness and applaud the remarkable feats achieved in the water*.

The Summer Olympics' swimming competitions have produced iconic moments that have etched themselves into the annals of sports history. Legendary swimmers like *Michael Phelps* and *Katie Ledecky* have become synonymous with Olympic glory, breaking records and setting new standards of excellence. The electrifying atmosphere in the swimming venue, coupled with the global viewership, elevates the sport to a pinnacle of excitement and anticipation. Beyond the medals and records, the swimming events at the Summer Olympics symbolize the universal pursuit of human potential, with athletes striving for personal bests and nations uniting to celebrate the awe-inspiring achievements in the pool.

**Improvement of the team in Olympic swimming events**


Embarking on our initial analysis, I am eager to delve into a concise research endeavor aimed at assessing *the improvements made by each of the selected eight teams in men's 200-meter races* across various disciplines, including backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly, individual medley, and freestyle. The participating countries are 'USA,' 'AUS,' 'GBR,' 'JPN,' 'GER,' 'CAN,' 'GDR,' and 'HUN.' The primary objective is to uncover and understand the specific improvements achieved by each team over the years in these distinct swimming strokes. 

Isn't the prospect of exploring the advancements in backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly, individual medley, and freestyle strokes intriguing?
