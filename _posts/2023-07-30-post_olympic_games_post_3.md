In the next chart I would like to present the average number of medals ( Gold + silver + Bronze )  each country has won during each event of the olympic team over the years since 1912.
Therefore, we chose 8 countries to - 'USA','AUS','GBR','JPN','GER','CAN','GDR','HUN'
Each dot presents the number of medals the team won during the olympic event in swimming. 
As we can see, the horizontal line in the chart presents the average of medals the specific team won. 
Dots under the horizontal line, which coloured with gray,  presents the amount of medals under the average medals value.
On the other side, Dots above the horizontal line, which are coloured with other colors,  present the amount of medals under the average medals value.
