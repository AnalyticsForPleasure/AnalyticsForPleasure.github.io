Today, our analysis extends to Kaggle-derived data, providing insights into the pricing trends of food items in Israel spanning several decades.

In the initial post, the focus was on vegetables, fruits, meat, fish, and chicken, revealing noteworthy price jumps every five years. Now, I aim to explore a different category of productsâ€”specifically, the pricing dynamics of dairy products in Israel. Consequently, I've chosen six items to investigate, ordered based on their price differences over a 15-year period.

The selected dairy products under examination are: 


* Hard yellow cheese from cow's milk (100 g)
* Leben (200 ml)
* Cottage cheese' (250 grams)
* Soft white cheese (250 grams)
* Margarine for spreading in a cup (250 grams)
* Natural yogurt in a plastic container (200 ml)
