Today, our analysis extends to Kaggle-derived data, providing insights into the pricing trends of food items in Israel spanning several decades.

In the initial post, the focus was on **vegetables, fruits, meat, fish, and chicken**, revealing noteworthy price jumps every five years. Now, I aim to explore a different category of productsâ€”specifically, the pricing dynamics of **dairy products** in Israel. Consequently, I've chosen six items to investigate, ordered based on their price differences over a 15-year period.

The selected dairy products under examination are: 


* Hard yellow cheese from cow's milk (100 g)
* Leben (200 ml)
* Cottage cheese' (250 grams)
* Soft white cheese (250 grams)
* Margarine for spreading in a cup (250 grams)
* Natural yogurt in a plastic container (200 ml)





Hence, in the chart presented below, I have examined these dairy products and plotted their performance on a scale from the year 2008 to 2022. The chart displays, in each row matrix, the product that experienced the most significant price increase (highlighted by the green rectangle, indicating the corresponding percentage).
