**Distribution of medals over the years**

We would like to explore our next question, which is to determine the number of teams/countries that have participated in the swimming events of the Olympic Games over the years. We are interested in understanding whether there has been a change in the number of teams since the inaugural Olympic Games held in Stockholm in 1912.
