**Industries that Have Experienced Temperature Changes over 10 Seasons**

Over the course of the first ten years, the show has been televised, numerous pitch presentations have taken place in front of the sharks panel. These pitches spanned various industries, ranging from “online services” to the "baby and Child care" sector. As a result, our upcoming research aims to uncover the industries that have experienced shifts in temperature over the ten-year period. By addressing this question, we can identify which industries have reached their peak or declined from their peak.

**Average Equity of Each Shark over Closing Deals, Divided by Gender**

The next thing that we would like to dive into is to find out for each deal which has been closed by each shark, what was the amount of equity settled during the negotiation process between the entrepreneur VS the shark. Therefore, we decided to add another element to the equation - for each closed deal by each shark we will divide the deals by the gender of the entrepreneur. For example : Mark Cuban, during 10 seasons of the show that has been aired on TV, he made 68 investment deals with entrepreneurs over the show. As we can notice below, The average equity (%) for a male entrepreneur was 28.6%, while the average equity (%) for a female entrepreneur was 26.4%.
