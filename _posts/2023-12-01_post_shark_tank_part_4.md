**Average Equity of Each Shark over Closing Deals, Divided by Gender**

The next thing that we would like to dive into is to find out for each deal which has been closed by each shark, what was the amount of equity settled during the negotiation process between the entrepreneur VS the shark. Therefore, we decided to add another element to the equation - for each closed deal by each shark we will divide the deals by the gender of the entrepreneur. For example : Mark Cuban, during 10 seasons of the show that has been aired on TV, he made 68 investment deals with entrepreneurs over the show. As we can notice below, The average equity (%) for a male entrepreneur was 28.6%, while the average equity (%) for a female entrepreneur was 26.4%.

**Number of Investments Made over the Seasons**

Our initial objective is to analyse the dataset and gather information on the total number of investments made by the panel of sharks in each season. To accomplish this, we aim to present this data visually using an area chart.

Upon examining the data, we observe a significant surge in the number of investments over the years, particularly between the second and sixth seasons. During this period, there was a remarkable increase of almost ~250%, with investments rising from 19 in the second season to 66 in the sixth season.
