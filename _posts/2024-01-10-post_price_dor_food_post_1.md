Throughout the last three decades in Israel, there has been a noticeable rise in the prices of fundamental food items, including **'Chicken Breast (1 kg),' 'Instant coffee (200 grams),' 'lemons (1 kg),' "Hard yellow cheese from cow's milk (100 g)," and 'Frozen beef - ribs (1 kg)**.' Consequently, I have undertaken a detailed examination of these specific items to delve deeper into the extent of the price increases over the years.
