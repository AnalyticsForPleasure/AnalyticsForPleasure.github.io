Greetings! 

I am Shay, a proud husband and father of two wonderful girls.
This blog comes into existence as a product of my immense gratitude, as it allows me to delve into my passion for data exploration during my precious moments of leisure. I find great joy and significance in analyzing and understanding data in a manner that surpasses the ordinary, making this journey truly captivating and rewarding.
