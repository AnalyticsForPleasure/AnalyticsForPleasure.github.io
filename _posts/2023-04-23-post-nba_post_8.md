The next drill down would be on the column named : 

The **Usg%** matrix is that calculates **what percentage of team plays a player was involved in while he was on the floor**, provided that the play ends in one of the three true results: 
1. field-goal attempt 
2. free-throw attempt
3. turnover

As we can see from the table above, the same James Harden we talked about before, leads the league in this category with his consistency, with **almost 40% over his 2018 season!**

During the seasons 2018 and a year afterwards, Harden had remarkable seasons with  **36.1 and 34.3 points**. In addition we can notice, James Harden, appears in this list 5 times between the 2016 to 2020.

In the table above we wanted to find out what is the average points for a player during their first 4 seasons in the league and to compare this result to the average points of the same player in his veteran years in the league,  in their 4 last four years.
 
As we can notice from the results above, we are able to separate the results into 2 groups.

The **first group** of players is a group which presents players who finished strong in their last 4 seasons. In this case,  the player's scoring points have been substantially increased - players as **James Harden** and **Giannis Ateokounmpo** doubled their points in their first 4 seasons.
 
The **second group** of players is a group which presents players who entered into the nba league by storm, during their first 4 seasons. And over seasons, their points number had decreased in double digits. In this group we have **Jerry Stackhouse, Elton Brand, Paul Pierce , Vince Carter and Juwan Howard and Steven Smith**.
 
 
Now we need to explain  the difference between the 2 groups:
* The **first group** presents us players who are playing so far  6-10 years in the league. Therefore, those players now reach their pick by scoring at the highest level  - James Harden has an average of 31.5 points ,   Giannis Ateokounmpo has an average of 28.5 points  in their last 4 seasons playing.
 
* The **second group** represents different kinds of players. I mean a different era of players which have already retired from NBA basketball. Therefore, Their scoring board points, after 15-16 years in the league, is much lower than the players who are in their prime now, and still playing.
