**How long the NBA career holds on? And what are the average seasons a player is able to continue and to compete in the professional level? Are there any exceptional players who were able to break the ads and played much more years?**

As I said before, in this dataset we have 2,333 players who played with NBA uniforms. 
Now, we would like to check them out, from the point of view of numbers of each player have been able to play.








As I wrote before, one of the possibilities for a rookie to get drafted at the NBA league is by playing before one of the colleges over the states.
An interesting point we would like to know is: 




**Which colleges are able to send away the most talented ( = ability of scoring points ) players?**


Therefore, I built a function which will show us the best colleges who send the plates to the nba level and succeed.

> need to add the table 

In order to illustrate the values from this function above I add a horizontal bar chart.
This horizontal bar shows us a list of colleges in which players have graduated and went to the NBA, and scored a yearly score of  30 points.

As we can see from the chart above, the top college which was able to send the best talented players to the NBA was Georgetown College .Their super star **Allen Iverson** who was drafted number one draft pick by the Philadelphia 76â€™s  was able to score 6 years continuously more than 27 points between the 1999 - 2005 seasons.

Also Arizona state was able to develop another talented  type of player named James Harden who joined the Houston Rockets after 5 year at the league. James was able to duplicate Allen Iverson's continuous scoring ability, almost a decade later, when he scored more than 27 points 6 year straight.
