Today, we will delve into an insightful analysis of a dataset sourced from Kaggle titled "Salary by Job Title and Country." This dataset presents a comprehensive view of salary information across various industries and global regions. Key columns include job titles, salary amounts, age, years of experience, and education levels.

Our initial exploration aims to answer the question: What specific roles do individuals with a Ph.D. typically occupy? Moreover, we seek to discern whether male Ph.D. holders gravitate towards different positions compared to their female counterparts with a Ph.D. Once we unravel the answers to these inquiries, our next focus will be on identifying potential gender-based salary disparities.

After identifying a limited selection of the top positions for both males and females, our objective is to calculate the average salary for each position within these groups. Additionally, we will further categorize salaries by gender, comparing the earnings of males versus females within each job category.
