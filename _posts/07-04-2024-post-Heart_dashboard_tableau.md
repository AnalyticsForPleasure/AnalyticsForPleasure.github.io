Today I would like to analyze a super interesting dataset about **heart disease**. The dataset has been taken from the Kaggle website. 

The dataset presents 18 columns categories and the column names are:

I would like to dive deep into the data, and afterward present the results over several charts using tableau software. Asuasaul we will start and present the Dashboard I make using Tableau. In order to analyze the data I used, as always - python.

Here a short glimpse over the dashboard:
