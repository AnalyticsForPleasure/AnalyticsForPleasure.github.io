Today, I'm taking a brief detour from my usual Python-centric writing to delve into data visualization with Tableau software. To kick off this exploration, I've selected an intriguing dataset from Kaggle titled 'Shooting School.'

This dataset originates from the K-12 School Shooting Database (K-12 SSDB), which meticulously documents instances involving the brandishing, firing, or impact of bullets on school property, irrespective of the number of victims, time of occurrence, or day of the week. After downloading the data, I conducted basic Excel queries to organize the information dispersed across multiple sheets.

For those interested, I recommend reviewing their research methodology to gain insight into their data collection and compilation process from various sources.

This dataset offers insights into school shooting incidents spanning the past five decades, commencing from May 1, 1970, along with the associated relative risk of fatality or injury in such events
