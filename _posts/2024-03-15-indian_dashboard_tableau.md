Today, I aim to blend two potent tools: **Python** (my usual go-to) and **Tableau** (as evidenced by my recent posts). Each excels in its own realmâ€”**Python for analysis in the domains of data science and data analytics**, and **Tableau for visualization, catering to graphic artists/designers and data analysts alike**. By leveraging both, we'll explore how to extract maximum value from data analysis and craft unique dashboards. *Let's dive into the data aspect!*

For today's endeavor, I've chosen to delve into a dataset sourced from Kaggle titled **"Indian Food"**. *Comprising 9 columns and 255 rows*, it promises an interesting exploration.

Here are the columns names:

As usual, I will start with a sneak peek of the output dashboard about "Indian Food":
