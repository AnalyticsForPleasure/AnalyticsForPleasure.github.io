Today I will write here my last post in a series of 3 posts that illustrate the advantage of powerful data visualization tools such as Tableau software over the rest on the market. 

As we can see from my first 2 posts ( click here  - [School Shooting Analysis](https://analyticsforpleasure.github.io/posts/post_Analyzing_school_shooting/), [Hotel Booking](https://analyticsforpleasure.github.io/posts/Hotel_booking/) ) ,Tableau is a **powerful data visualization tool** that allows users to create interactive and visually appealing charts, graphs, and dashboards from various data sources. Tableau's robust features enable users to analyze and explore data dynamically, facilitating data-driven decision-making processes across organizations. Additionally, Tableau offers integration with a wide range of data sources, including spreadsheets, databases, and cloud services, enhancing its versatility and usability in diverse analytical contexts.

In order to  create a dashboard I firstly downloaded the dataset taken from the kaggle website.

This dataset contains *1000 rows* and *16 columns*.
Here are the column names: *Poster_Link,Series_Title , Series_Title , Released_Year , Certificate, Runtime , Genre , IMDB_Rating, Overview, Meta_score, Director, Star1- star4, No_of_Votes , Gross.*

While the dataset offers opportunities to explore numerous inquiries, our dashboard will focus on addressing just four specific questions.


Letâ€™s give a short glimpse over the dashboard output:
