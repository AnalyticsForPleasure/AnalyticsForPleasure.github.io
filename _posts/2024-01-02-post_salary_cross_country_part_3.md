**Exploring Salary and Age Patterns Across Job Titles with Dot Plots**


In our upcoming investigation, we aim to utilize a dot plot to visualize the salary distribution across various job positions in comparison to the corresponding age distribution for each role. The chart, depicted below, employs the salary range on the X-axis and the age range on the Y-axis for a specific job.

To enhance our analysis, I've incorporated two lines into the plot. The first, a vertical line, represents the "Avg Age" for the given job, while the second, a horizontal line, represents the "Avg Salary" for that job category.

The intersection of these lines forms distinct squares on the chart, each conveying valuable information:

The upper-left corner denotes the lowest salaries for the youngest workers.
The upper-right corner showcases the highest salaries for the youngest workers.
The lower-left corner illustrates the lowest salary range for the oldest workers.
The lower-right corner reflects the highest salary range for the oldest workers.
By examining the placement of each job title within these charted distributions, we can discern valuable insights into the salary and age dynamics for different positions.
