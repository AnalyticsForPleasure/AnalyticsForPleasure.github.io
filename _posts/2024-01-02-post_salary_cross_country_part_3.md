**Exploring Salary and Age Patterns Across Job Titles with Dot Plots**



In our upcoming study, we aim to use a dot plot to illustrate how salaries are distributed across various job positions in comparison to the age distribution for each role. The chart below displays salary ranges on the X-axis and age ranges on the Y-axis, specifically tailored to each job.

I've included two lines on the plot for added context: a vertical line indicating the average age for the job and a horizontal line indicating the average salary. The intersection of these lines forms distinct squares, each conveying specific insights:

The upper-left square shows the lowest salaries for the youngest workers.
The upper-right square highlights the highest salaries for the youngest workers.
The lower-left square illustrates the lowest salary range for the oldest workers.
The lower-right square reveals the highest salary range for the oldest workers.
By examining the placement of each job title within these charted distributions, we can gain valuable insights into salary and age dynamics for different positions.
