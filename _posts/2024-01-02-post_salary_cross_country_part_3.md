**Exploring Salary and Age Patterns Across Job Titles with Dot Plots**



In our upcoming study, we aim to explore the distribution of salaries and age ranges for various job positions using a dot plot. The chart illustrates salary ranges on the X-axis and age ranges on the Y-axis, specific to each job.

Adding two lines enhances our analysis: a vertical line indicates the average age for the job, while a horizontal line signifies the average salary. The intersection of these lines forms distinct squares, each revealing unique insights:

* The upper-left square depicts the lowest salaries for the youngest workers.
* The upper-right square highlights the highest salaries for the youngest workers.
* The lower-left square signifies the lowest salary range for the oldest workers.
* The lower-right square indicates the highest salary range for the oldest workers.

As we delve into specific job roles, such as Data Scientist, we observe the intersection point representing the average salary (157,000 $) for an average age of 33 years. Notably, there's a high density of workers under 33 earning above the average salary. Additionally, the lower-left corner has a high density, suggesting that salaries don't decline significantly as workers age.
