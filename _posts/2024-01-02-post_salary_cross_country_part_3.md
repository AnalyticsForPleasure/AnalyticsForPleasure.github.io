**Exploring Salary and Age Patterns Across Job Titles with Dot Plots**



In our upcoming research, we aim to explore the distribution of salaries for various job positions in comparison to the age distribution within the same roles, utilizing a dot plot. In the chart provided below, the X-axis represents salary ranges, and the Y-axis corresponds to age ranges specific to each job.

To enhance our analysis, two lines have been incorporated: a vertical line indicating the average age for a particular job and a horizontal line indicating the average salary. The points where these lines intersect create distinct squares, each revealing unique insights:

> The upper-left square shows the lowest salaries for the youngest workers.
> The upper-right square highlights the highest salaries for the youngest workers.
> The lower-left square signifies the lowest salary range for the oldest workers.
> The lower-right square signifies the highest salary range for the oldest workers.



As we delve into the details, examining the initial chart for the role of a *Data Scientist*, we observe the intersection point of the two lines. This point represents an average age of 33 years and an average salary of $157,000 for Data Scientists. Additionally, there is a noticeable concentration of workers under 33 years old earning more than the average salary. Moreover, a high density is observed in the lower-left corner, indicating that salaries do not decrease significantly as workers age.
